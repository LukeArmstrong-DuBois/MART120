    <h1>What I did for week 7!</h1>
    <br>
    This week I added more personality to my page with Cascading Style Sheets!<br>
    Using CSS let me get very creative with the look of my web page.<br>
    I really wanted to capture the essence of wacky 90s or early 2000s website and I think I did a pretty good job!<br>
