    <h1>What I did for week 13!</h1>
    <br>
    This week I cleaned up my code by using functions!<br>
    Because last weeks project requited a lot of code, it makes cense that cleaning up and organizing would take priority.<br> 
    After completing this assignment, I can definitely understand how important clean code can be in making work easier.<br>
