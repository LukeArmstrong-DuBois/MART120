    <h1>What I did for week 15!</h1>
    <br>
    For my final week I used object oriented programming to make changing parts of my page easier!<br>
    Adding extra details to my pages was very tedious before learning about and using OOP.<br>
     Adding a tree to make my game feel more alive would require a lot of code, which was especially true if I wanted to add more then one.<br>
    However, OOP helped me with this problem and let me really get creative with my game.<br>
