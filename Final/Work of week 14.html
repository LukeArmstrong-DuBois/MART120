    <h1>What I did for week 14!</h1>
    <br>
    This week I used Arrays to make make maintenance on my page easier!<br>
    At this point in the semester, I had come back to the same projects many times.<br>
    Learning about Arrays and their ability to make changes to my page easier was very helpful.<br>
