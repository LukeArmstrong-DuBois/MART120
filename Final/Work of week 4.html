    <h1>What I did for week 4!</h1>
    <br>
    This week I used studio code to make a choose your own adventure about overcoming a fear of clowns!<br>
    I really enjoyed this assignment as it let me really experiment with what I could create.<br>
     I had always wanted to make a text-based adventure story, so this was project was very exciting to make.<br>
