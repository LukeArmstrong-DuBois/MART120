    <h1>What I did for week 2!</h1>
    <br>
    In this week I wrote two essays and worked with code.com<br>
    Instead of immediately jumping into html pages, the first few weeks of this class gave me a chance to learn the concepts of coding with learning recourses for absolute beginners.<br>
    These first few assignments really helped feel less intimidated about working with code.<br>
