    <h1>What I did for week 9!</h1>
    <br>
    This week I made a self portrait on an html page!<br>
    After last week being pretty difficult, it was nice to try something different and try my best to capture my likeness with simple shapes.<br>
     The bald head is completely deliberate due to me having a shaved head at the time.<br>
