    <h1>What I did for week 1!</h1><br>
    
    For the first week of class I wrote this essay on the differnces between GUI & CLI.<br>
    Because this was the first week, I was pretty nervous for when the hands-on coding would start.<br> 
    However, this first assignment did a great job in helping me understand concepts before I started coding.<br>
