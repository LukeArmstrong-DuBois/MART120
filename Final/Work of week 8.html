    <h1>What I did for week 8!</h1>
    <br>
    This week I used JavaScript to make my page check if something happened!<br>
    This was definitely one of the harder assignments this semester.<br>
    While I have a much better understanding of JavaScript now, at this time, I was very confused!<br>
