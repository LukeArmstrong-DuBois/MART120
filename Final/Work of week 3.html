    <h1>What I did for week 3!</h1>
    <br>
    This week focused on coding in Scratch. I made a short story about a dog from outer space!<br>
    I learned concepts like if statements and sequences that I would use a lot later in the semester.<br>
    Because these concepts were taught in a very beginner friendly way them being used later in the class felt very natural.<br>
