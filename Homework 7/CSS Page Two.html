        <h4>Here's the start of a story I was working on last year:</h4>
        <div class="STORYTXT"> The light buzz of the ceiling lights had become white noise to Arthur at this point.<br>
         He had always look at hospitals as a place where people got better, but although he had been laying on one of their sterile beds for long enough to drive someone into madness, he didn’t feel better. Arthur was never much for feelings anyways though. As long as he could remember, Arthur just existed without thinking or doing much else.<br>
         Of course, this is expected from someone who’s only memories come from the white bed he is laying in now.<br>
         “My eyes hurt” he thought to himself.<br>
         Then stop starting at the lights.<br>
         His body ached as he moved to his side. Since childhood, he had always slept like this. At lest that what he remembered. The strange thing about Arthur’s memory lost is that seemingly random parts of his past remain. Why did his childhood sleep position stay, but when things about the faces of his parents their blank.  
         It made him mad just to think about it.</div>
